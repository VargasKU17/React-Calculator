# React-Calculator

This is a web app that I previously built using Vanilla JS. I decided to rebuild it using React JS. It has the same features as a simple calculator. 
I plan on eventually doing updates to make this into a React Native application that will have other features for other types of calculations.

What I learned 

My familiarity with the basics of React increased significantly. This is my second React project and I was able to develop it at a much faster rate than my first.
 I learned even more clearly when and why to use functional statesless components and class componenets. Like my flashcard app, I developed this from scratch to the point of hosting the project on Firebase, which was a practical experience.
